# Advent of Code

This repo collects my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles.

Currently the main language is Python 3. For each day, I write a script called "solve.py" which prints the results for each part of the puzzle of the day, for both the small example input and my real inputs. Both small and real inputs are saved to files.

This code is written by me, without the aid of an AI tool like ChatGPT or Copilot, as the spirit of AoC is to have fun solving puzzles, not just to produce solutions with whatever means.
